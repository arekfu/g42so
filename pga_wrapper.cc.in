/* This source files provides wrappers around the construction and the
 * destruction of your primary-generator-action class, which should derive from
 * G4VUserPrimaryGeneratorAction. You can expand the code as you like, for
 * instance by adding parameters to the class constructor or by calling your
 * particle factories. Just make sure you expose the required createG4PGA and
 * deleteG4PGA functions.
 *
 * Note that the Geant4 kernel is NOT available here, e.g. there is no
 * RunManager around at the moment these functions are called. This might
 * change in the future.
 *
 * Once you have modified this file, save it and pass it to t4g4 as a source
 * file. Make sure you add the --custom-pga-wrapper CLI option, so that
 * t4g4 does not include its standard wrapper.
